The ``/scans/`` resource
========================

Scanning a Web application using w3af's REST API requires the developer to
understand this basic workflow:

 * Start a new scan using ``POST`` to ``/scans/``
 * Get the scan status using ``GET`` to ``/scans/0``
 * Use :doc:`kb` to get information about the identified vulnerabilities
 * Clear all scan results before starting a new scan by sending a ``DELETE`` to ``/scans/0``

Optionally send these requests to control and monitor the scan:

 * Get a list of all currently running scans using a ``GET`` to ``/scans/``
 * Pause the scan using ``GET`` to ``/scans/0/pause``
 * Stop the scan using ``GET`` to ``/scans/0/stop``
 * Retrieve the scan log using ``GET`` to ``/scans/0/log``

.. warning::

   The current REST API implementation does not allow users to run more than
   one concurrent scan.

.. note::

   In the previous examples I've used ``/scans/0`` (note the hard-coded zero in
   the URL) as an example. When starting a new scan a new ID will be created.

Starting a scan
---------------

Performing a ``POST`` to the ``/scans/`` resource is one of the most complex
requests in our REST API. The call requires two specially crafted variables:

 * ``scan_profile`` which must contain the contents of a ``w3af`` scan profile (not the file name)
 * ``target_urls`` a list containing URLs to seed ``w3af``'s crawler

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import json

    data = {'scan_profile': file('/path/to/profile.pw3af').read(),
            'target_urls': ['http://127.0.0.1:8000/audit/sql_injection/']}

    response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:5000/scans/',
                             data=json.dumps(data),
                             headers={'content-type': 'application/json'})


A successful HTTP ``POST`` request ``/scans/`` looks like this:

.. code-block:: http

    POST /scans/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: 127.0.0.1:5000
    Content-Length: 2001
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Accept: */*
    User-Agent: python-requests/2.6.1 CPython/2.7.6 Linux/3.13.0-49-generic
    Connection: keep-alive
    content-type: application/json

    {
        "target_urls": ["http://127.0.0.1:8000/audit/sql_injection/"],
        "scan_profile": "[grep.strange_headers]\n\n[crawl.web_spider]\nonly_forward = False\nfollow_regex = .*\nignore_regex = \n\n"
    }


And the expected answer is a ``201`` status code:

.. code-block:: http

    HTTP/1.0 201 CREATED
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 61
    Server: REST API - w3af
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
    Pragma: no-cache
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Expires: 0
    Date: Wed, 29 Jul 2015 11:52:55 GMT

    {
      "href": "/scans/0",
      "id": 0,
      "message": "Success"
    }


.. note::

   Remember to send the ``Content-Type: application/json`` header

.. note::

   In order to avoid issues with incorrect paths referenced by a plugin
   configuration inside the ``scan_profile`` it is recommended to use
   ``self-contained`` profiles.
