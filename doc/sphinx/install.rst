Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure you have the following software ready before starting the installation:

 * Git client: ``sudo apt-get install git``
 * Python 2.7, which is installed by default in most systems
 * Pip version 1.1: ``sudo apt-get install python-pip``

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:andresriancho/w3af.git
    cd w3af/
    ./w3af_console
    . /tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh


Let me explain what's going on there:

 * First we use ``git`` to download ``w3af``'s source code
 * Then we try to run the ``w3af_console`` command, which will most likely fail because of missing dependencies. This command will generate a helper script at ``/tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh`` that when run will install all the required dependencies.
 * Dependencies are installed by running ``/tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh``

The framework dependencies don't change too often, but don't be alarmed if after updating your installation ``w3af`` requires you to install new dependencies.

Supported platforms
-------------------

The framework should work on all Python supported platforms and has been tested in various Linux distributions, Mac OSX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

.. note::

   The platform used for development and running our continuous integration tests is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

.. warning::

   While in theory you can install w3af in Microsoft Windows, we don't recommend nor support that installation process.

One of the ugly details users can find is that ``w3af`` needs to detect the Operating System / Linux distribution, and then have support for creating the ``/tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh`` for that specific combination. In other words, for Ubuntu we use ``apt-get install`` and for Suse we use ``yum install``.

The list of distributions ``w3af`` knows how to generate the installation script for `is extensive <https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/tree/feature/module/w3af/core/controllers/dependency_check/platforms>`_ . If we don't support your distribution, we'll default to Ubuntu.

Installation in Kali
--------------------

`According to Kali's documentation <http://www.kali.org/kali-monday/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/>`_ in order to avoid breaking the packaged ``w3af`` version you should run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    cd ~
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y python-pip
    pip install --upgrade pip
    git clone https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af.git
    cd w3af
    ./w3af_console
    . /tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh

This allows you to use the latest w3af version without breaking or overriding the one installed using Kali's package system.

.. note::

   There are two versions in your OS now:
    * ``cd ~/w3af/ ; ./w3af_console`` will run the latest version
    * ``w3af_console`` will run the one packaged in Kali

Troubleshooting
---------------

After running the helper script w3af still says I have missing python dependencies, what should I do?
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

You will recognize this when this message appears: "Your python installation needs the following modules to run w3af".

First you'll want to check that all the dependencies are installed. To do that just follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd w3af
    $ ./w3af_console
    ...
    Your python installation needs the following modules to run w3af:
    futures
    ...
    $ pip freeze | grep futures
    futures==2.1.5
    $

Replace ``futures`` with the library that is missing in your system. If the ``pip freeze | grep futures`` command returns an empty result, you'll need to install the dependency using the ``/tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh`` command. Pay special attention to the output of that command, if installation fails you won't be able to run ``w3af``.

It is important to notice that ``w3af`` requires specific versions of the third-party libraries. The specific versions required at ``/tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh`` need to match the ones you see in the output of ``pip freeze``. If the versions don't match you can always install a specific version using ``pip install --upgrade futures==2.1.5``.

w3af still says I have missing operating system dependencies, what should I do?
_______________________________________________________________________________

You will recognize this when this message appears: "please install the following operating system packages".

Most likely you're using an unsupported Linux distribution. *This doesn't mean that w3af won't work with your distribution!* It just means that we haven't defined the steps required for making it run into our code.

What you need to do is:

 * Find a match between the Ubuntu package name given in the list and the one for your distribution
 * Install it
 * Run ``./w3af_console`` again. Repeat until fixed

If you have two minutes, please `create a ticket <https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/issues/new>`_ explaining the packages you installed, your distribution, etc. and we'll add the code necessary for others to be able to install ``w3af`` without going through any manual steps.

How do I ask for support on installation issues?
________________________________________________

You can `create a ticket <https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/issues/new>`_ containing the following information:

 * Your linux distribution (usually the contents of ``/etc/lsb-release`` will be enough)
 * The contents of the ``/tmp/w3af_dependency_install.sh`` file
 * The output of ``pip freeze``
 * The output of ``python --version``
