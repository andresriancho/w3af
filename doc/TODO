The w3af project has a very well defined roadmap, which aims to deliver value
to our users and the community in every step we take. The roadmap can be found
in our Github issue tracker:

There are lots of very interesting problems to solve, they range from enhancing
algorithms for detecting vulnerabilities and low level performance improvements
to user interface usability enhancements.
