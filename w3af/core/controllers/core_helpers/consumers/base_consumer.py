        The task_in_progress_counter is needed because we want to know if the

        in the has_pending_work().

        For example:

            * You can have pending work if there are items in the input_queue

            * You can have pending work if there are still items to be read from
            the output_queue by one of the consumers that reads our output.

            * You can have pending work when there are no items in input_queue

        _task_done, the Python2.7 pool implementation won't call it if the
