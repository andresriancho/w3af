    In most cases this will just be a wrapper around copy.deepcopy(instance)
    without any added features, but when that fails because of a race condition
    such as dictionary changed size during iteration - crawl_plugin.py #8956 ,
    then we retry.

    I don't want to debug the real issue since it only happen once and I can
    live with the retry.
