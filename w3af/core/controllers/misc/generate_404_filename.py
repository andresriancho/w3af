    Some web applications are really picky about the URL format, or have
    different 404 handling for the URL format. So we're going to apply these
    rules for generating a filename that doesn't exist:

        * Flip the characters of the same type (digit, letter), ignoring
        the file extension (if any):
            'ab-23'      ==> 'ba-32'
            'abc-12'     ==> 'bac-12'
            'ab-23.html' ==> 'ba-32.html'

        * If after the character flipping the filename is equal to the
        original one, +2 to each char:
            'a1a2'      ==> 'c3c4"
            'a1a2.html' ==> 'c3c4.html"

        * There is an edge case which was reported in [0] which affects
        files like '.ssh' or '.env'. These files (at least from w3af's
        perspective) don't have a name and have an extension. When we
        find a file like this we'll just randomize the filename and
        keep the extension.
