    Given that more than one vulnerability can be detected using time delays
    which are not 100% exact, just to name a couple: blind SQL injections using
    the MySQL's BENCHMARK and REDoS, I decided to create a generic class that
    will help me detect those vulnerabilities in an accurate and generic manner.

    This class works for approximated time delays, this means that we DO NOT
    NEED to control how many seconds the remote server will "sleep" before
    returning the response
    
    A good example to understand this is MySQL's sleep(x) vs. benchmark(...).
    This class solves the benchmark(...) issue while ExactDelay solves the
    sleep(x) issue.
    
    Note that these delays are applied ONLY if all the previous delays worked
    so adding more here will only increase accuracy and not performance since
    you'll only get slower scans when there is a vulnerability, which is not
    the most common case
    
    The delay multiplier means: "try to delay for twice the time of the
    original request". In other words, if the original request said
    BENCHMARK(2500000,MD5(1)) then if the multiplier is a 2 the next request
    will send BENCHMARK(5000000,MD5(1)) and if the multiplier is a 4 it will
    send BENCHMARK(10000000,MD5(1)).
    
    After sending the request, the algorithm will verify that the response
    was delayed at least multiplier * original_time to continue with the
    next step
