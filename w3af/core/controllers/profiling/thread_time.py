This file is a very hackish way to retrieve thread CPU time in Linux.

Definition of thread CPU time:
    > The amount of time the CPU spent on the given thread.

The thread could be in three states:
   #1 Waiting for IO (network, fs, etc)
   #2 IDLE (kernel paused the thread)
   #3 Running thread code (consuming CPU cycles)
   #4 Running kernel code associated with the thread (consuming CPU cycles)

thread_active_time() returns (#3 + #4)

The problem I'm trying to solve is explained by me in an email to the
PyAR mailing list [0], and the inspiration for this implementation comes
from the monotonic [1] module.

Please note that this method *only works on linux*, for any other operating
systems I just return the result of calling time.time().
