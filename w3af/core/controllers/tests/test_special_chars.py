    This test verifies that a fix for the bug identified while scanning
    demo.testfire.net is still working as expected. The issue was that the
    site had a form that looked like:

    <form action="/xyz">
        <intput name="foo" value="bar+spam" type="hidden">
        <intput name="eggs" type="text">
        ...
    </form>

    And when trying to send a request to that form the "+" in the value
    was sent as %20. The input was an .NET's EVENTVALIDATION thus it was
    impossible to find any bugs in the "eggs" parameter.

    Please note that this is a functional test and a unittest (which does not
    verify that everything works as expected) can be found at test_form.py
