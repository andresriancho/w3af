class DiskList(object):
    """
    A DiskList is a sqlite3 wrapper which has the following features:
        - Implements a list-like API
        - Stores all list items in a sqlite3 table
        - Is thread safe
        - Implements an iterator and a reversed iterator
        - Deletes the table when the DiskList object is deleted from memory

    I had to replace the old DiskList because the old one did not support
    iteration, and the only way of adding iteration to that object was doing
    something like this:

    def __iter__(self):
        return self._shelve.keys()

    Which in most cases would be stupid, because it would have to retrieve all
    the values saved on disk to memory, and then perform iteration over that
    list. Another problem is that this iteration was performed tons of times,
    thus slowing down the whole process with many disk reads of tens and maybe
    hundreds of MB's.
