class KBObserver(object):
    """
    When you want to listen to KB changes the best way is to create a KBObserver
    instance and call kb.add_observer(kb_observer). Then, the KB will call the
    methods in this instance to notify you about the changes.

    This is a base implementation that you should extend in order to provide
    real features. For now we just define the methods with a no-op
    implementation.

    Note that the methods in this class are named just like the ones in
    KnowledgeBase which trigger the calls.
