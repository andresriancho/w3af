    This class was an experiment related with performance enhancements of w3af's
    parsers.

    There were many issues, one of them was that I was applying greedy
    regular expressions to all HTTP responses; so I thought it might be a good
    idea to actually parse JS and then extract links from the strings!

    Sadly parsing JS was really slow (at least for just extracting strings),
    both pynarcissus and pynoceros used 100% CPU for >=1.5 seconds to parse
    the latest jquery.

    If we compare that with just applying the regular expressions to the JS,
    which takes around 0.005 seconds... it simply makes no sense.

    Not removing this class because I believe it might be useful for the future,
    in case I actually want to do something advanced with a javascript source
    code.
