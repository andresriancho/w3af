      BankID authentication order resource.

      To be able to use BankID authentication users must install the BankID app
      and order a BankID from their bank.


      A basic authentication flow has the following steps:

      1. an authentication order is created for an end user's personal identity
      number by requesting /bankid/orders resource

      2. the end user opens the BankID app on a PC or mobile device

      3. an authentication token is created for the authenticated user by
      requesting /bankid/tokens resource until success
