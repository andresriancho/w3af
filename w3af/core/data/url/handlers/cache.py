        #       related but different tasks:
        #
        #           1- Storing HTTP requests and responses in a DB
        #
        #           2- Answering HTTP requests by querying the DB (caching)
        #
        #       The problem is that all HTTP responses need to be stored in the
        #       database, but only a few of those (the ones with the proper headers)
        #       need to be answered by default_open()
        #
        #       Maybe when storing the HTTP request and response we could inspect
        #       the HTTP response headers for cache indicators, and store the
        #       "can be returned from cache" boolean in a DB column
        #
        #       The new DB column would then be used by `exists_in_cache` (see
        #       above) to decide if the response should be returned from the
        #       cache
