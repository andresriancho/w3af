    A simple handler that says: "30x responses are not errors".
    
    Please note that this is an HTTPRedirectHandler. We do NOT want to
    follow any HTTP redirects in an "automagic" way, so we need to override
    the default HTTPRedirectHandler from urllib2.
    
    If the user/plugin needs to follow a redirect he needs to do it manually.
    In cases such as the web_spider.py this is not an issue since it will
    perform an HTTP request and then create the fuzzable requests:
    
        resp = self._uri_opener.send_mutant(fuzzable_req)

        fuzz_req_list = self._create_fuzzable_requests(
            resp,
            request=fuzzable_req,
            add_self=False
        )
    
    If the "resp" object in that code is a 302, the _create_fuzzable_requests
    will take care of parsing the "Location" header and returning a fuzzable
    request (in fuzz_req_list) for it.
