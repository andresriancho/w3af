        This plugin exports all discovered HTTP requests to an output file. The
        output can then be read in another scan by the crawl.import_results to
        avoid performing an expensive crawling phase.

        The file format is simple:

         * HTTP requests are serialized to a string (just how they would be
           sent to the wire)

         * Base64 encoding is used to encode the serialized request

         * Each encoded request is stored in a new line

        One configurable parameter exists:
