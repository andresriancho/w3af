        of the file being uploaded, if special extensions are required, they can
        be added here.

        see if they are really what their extension is telling. To bypass this
        check, this plugin uses file templates located at "plugins/audit/file_upload/",
        this templates are valid files for each extension that have a section
        (the comment field in a gif file for example ) that can be replaced
        by scripting code ( PHP, ASP, etc ).

        After uploading the file, this plugin will try to find it on common
        directories like "upload" and "files" on every know directory. If the
        file is found, a vulnerability exists.
