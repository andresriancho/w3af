Fairly benign, really except when you consider using them for evil purposes. For example, an institution stands up a proxy server for their internal users to get to the outside world. Then, the internal user surf all over to their hearts content (including intranet pages cuz well, the admins are stupid) Voila, intranet links show up in the external cache report. Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I've noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* ('scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario. Let's say there's not security problems revealed in these logs.

By searching on web pages with titles of &quot;Welcome to IIS 4.0&quot; we find that even if they've taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. Old code: FREE with operating system.Poor content management: an average of $40/hour. Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system.Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.For all the things money can't buy, there's a googleDork award.</textualDescription></signature><signature><signatureReferenceNumber>15</signatureReferenceNumber><link>https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/15/</link><category>Sensitive Directories</category><querystring>http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Index+of+/backup%22&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;filter=0</querystring><shortDescription>Look in my backup directories!

Systems Affected: EasyWeb FileManager 1.0 RC-1Technical Description: The PostNuke module works by loading a directory and/or file via the &quot;pathext&quot; (directory) and &quot;view&quot; (file) variables. Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the &quot;pathext&quot; variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the &quot;view&quot; variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:/etc directory listing:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/etc/passwd file:/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/&amp;view=passwdFix/Workaround:Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to bemaintaining EW FileManager.Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.Credir: Sullo - cirt.netNOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module.</textualDescription></signature><signature><signatureReferenceNumber>388</signatureReferenceNumber><link>https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/388/</link><category>Vulnerable Servers</category><querystring>http://www.google.com/search?q=allinurl:%22index.php%22+%22site=sglinks%22&amp;num=100&amp;start=100</querystring><shortDescription>allinurl:&quot;index.php&quot; &quot;site=sglinks&quot;</shortDescription><textualDescription>Easyins Stadtportal v4 is a German Content Management System for cities and regions.

This allows for a window of opportunity for an attacker to execute a malicious script on a server.Gallery 1.4.4 is reported prone to this issue, however, other versions may be affected as well. &quot;</textualDescription></signature><signature><signatureReferenceNumber>450</signatureReferenceNumber><link>https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/450/</link><category>Files containing juicy info</category><querystring>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=filetype%3AQDF+QDF</querystring><shortDescription>Quicken data files</shortDescription><textualDescription>The QDATA.QDF file (found sometimes in zipped &quot;QDATA&quot; archives online, sometimes not) contains financial data, including banking accounts, credit card numbers, etc. This search has only a couple hits so far, but this should be popular in the coming year as Quicken 2005 makes it very easy and suggests to backup your data online.</textualDescription></signature><signature><signatureReferenceNumber>451</signatureReferenceNumber><link>https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/451/</link><category>Files containing passwords</category><querystring>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=filetype%3Aini+wcx_ftp</querystring><shortDescription>filetype:ini wcx_ftp</shortDescription><textualDescription>This searches for Total commander FTP passwords (encrypted) in a file called wcx_ftp.ini.

Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.CGI-proxy's default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:&quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.&quot;The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:inurl:&quot;nph-proxy.cgi&quot; &quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy&quot;More results can be obtained by admitting the &quot;inurl:nph-proxy.cgi&quot; constraint, but much more trash is generated as well.</textualDescription></signature><signature><signatureReferenceNumber>467</signatureReferenceNumber><link>https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/467/</link><category>Sensitive Directories</category><querystring>http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=intitle%3A%22Index+of+*%22+inurl%3A%22my+shared+folder%22+size+modified&amp;btnG=Search</querystring><shortDescription>intitle:&quot;Index of *&quot; inurl:&quot;my shared folder&quot; size modified</shortDescription><textualDescription>These are index pages of &quot;My Shared Folder&quot;.

If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.The second issue is an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability. It may be possible for a remote user to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the underlying database used by the application. This could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.Successful exploitation could result in compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.</textualDescription></signature><signature><signatureReferenceNumber>624</signatureReferenceNumber><link>https://www.exploit-db.com/ghdb/624/</link><category>Advisories and Vulnerabilities</category><querystring>http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Powered+by+My+Blog%22+intext%3A%22FuzzyMonkey.org%22&amp;btnG=Search</querystring><shortDescription>&quot;Powered by My Blog&quot; intext:&quot;FuzzyMonkey.org&quot;</shortDescription><textualDescription>FuzzyMonkey My Blog is vulnerable to multiple input validation vulnerabilities.

There is much to see and most of the cameras have easy acccess to admin profile via click of a button - of course from there you have to provide a UID &amp; PW.

directories of a plug-in that enables Wordpress to be used as a forum. Many 
of the results of the search also show error logs which give an attacker the 
server side paths including the home directory name. This name is often also 
used for the login to ftp and shell access, which exposes the system to 
attack. There is also an undisclosed flaw in version 1.3 of the software, as 
the author has mentioned in version 1.4 as a security fix, but does not tell 
us what it is that was patched.

Google Dork &quot;allinurl:forcedownload.php?file=&quot;

Sites that use the forcedownload.php script are vulnerable to url 
manipulation, and will spit out any file on the local site, including the 
PHP files themselves with all server side code, not the rendered page, but 
the source itself. This is most commonly used on wordpress sites to grab the 
wp-config.php file to gain access to the database, but is not limited to 
wordpress sites. I only list it as an example, so people understand the 
weight of flaw.

By default, while subscribing to a mailing list on a website, running

There is an option of getting password reminder email for this list

Along with sending the password reminder mail in *plain text* to the

These files contain clear text usernames and passwords.� They also contain the hostname or IP to connect to as well as the port.� Most of these results will be for FTP however, you can also get port 22 to SSH in.� This dork of course can be modified to target a specific website by appending site:whateversite.com.� You can also look for a specific username like root by appending &quot;root&quot; to the dork.��

Searches for fckeditor default url and which has a config.asp file where configisenabled = true.

This may be old, though the existing DORKS didn't call it out specifically, and google still gives a lot of hits.

# Date: 02-06-2015
# Vendor Homepage:  http://www.nusphere.com
# Software Link: http://www.nusphere.com/products/dbg_wizard_download.htm

DBG Wizard is meant to be used with the DBG PHP debugger as an aid to
configuring it correctly. It is supplied as a PHP script called
dbg-wizard.php which when placed in the root folder of a web site and
executed provides instructions to the user about setting up their web
server so the debugger can be used.

It is not meant to be present on a live site as it exposes details
about software configurations and versions which might allow an
attacker to discover other vulnerabilities. If the DBG shared library
is also installed it will expose that fact and potentially assist an
attacker in crafting a request to start a debug session in which they
could do anything that can be done through a PHP script, including
reading files and accessing database entries.

This dork allows you to see Onenote files stored in the open(*.one). These
files can be read easily with Onenote or a compatible viewer, no password,
no encryption.
The onetoc2 is added, it's a worthless file but is always inside a folder
containing one or several onenote files(and it obviously helps narrowing
the search to what we're looking for).

This dork allows you to look for Hyperfile databases(.FIC) stored in the
open. You can simply read them in a text editor(You'll see the header and
then the database content in plain text) or you can convert them(to xml,
excel, ...) with free software. In order to convert them, you also need the
linked index file (.NDX) and optional mmo file which are located in the
same directory.
Some Windev/Webdev installations store usernames and other sensitive
information in that kind of file.

you are getting hacked by a whole team.
