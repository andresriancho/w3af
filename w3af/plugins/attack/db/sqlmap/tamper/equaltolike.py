    Replaces all occurances of operator equal ('=') with operator 'LIKE'

        * Microsoft SQL Server 2005

    Notes:
        * Useful to bypass weak and bespoke web application firewalls that
          filter the equal character ('=')
        * The LIKE operator is SQL standard. Hence, this tamper script
          should work against all (?) databases
